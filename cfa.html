                I've worked at two different Chick-Fil-A's in two different cities. My first CFA was in Friendswood, and I worked at this restaurant
                for just under 1.5 years before I came to college. The second CFA I worked at was in the neighboring 
                town, Pearland, TX. I worked there from the summer after my Freshman year of college all the way until the end of Winter break my Sophomore year of college.

                <br>
                <br>
                Having Chick-Fil-A being such a prevalent part of my life in the workforce, I not only developed strong, essential skills in teamwork,
                leadership, guest relations, and communication, but I also had the chance to meet many, many people of different backgrounds and situations.
                whether I like or not, working at Chick-Fil-A made me a stronger person. Most of my fellow employees I worked with were
                charismatic, understanding, charming individuals that taught me a lot of life lessons. As stupid as it might sound, from
                CFA, I learned that not everyone is NEARLY as fortunate as me. Working there taught me a stronger form of empathy and sympathy... something
                that isn't taught in school. From CFA, I'm a better employee, leader, and overall man.

                Above and below this summary are many pictures from my time at both Chick-Fil-A's. Pictures that I cherish dearly, and pictures
                that hold a special place in my heart.
