        <p class = "describingText">Apollo, also known as Apollo Finance is a web application
            developed in HTML, CSS, Python and JavaScript for HackUTD IX. HackUTD IX is part of a coding event known
            as a hackathon. Hackathons are 24-48 hour periods in which global companies give students a couple of prompts. These prompts 
            are esstentially giant software development questions and its the students, (and their teams of 1-4 people) to develp these prompts
            however way possible. We chose Capital One and Goldman Sachs' prompt, which was, to summarize, "create an risk analysis tool to help people 
            invest their money." After creating Apollo, we pitched it to employees of said companies in hopes to win a material prize.
            
            <br><br>
            
            My hackathon team and fellow co-creators consisted of 
            <!--Hyperlinking my teammates LinkedIn's to the page-->
            <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuckerstrow/" class = "teammates">Tucker Strow</a>,

            Our platform, Apollo utilizes strong form efficiency to calculate beta values and expected returns of
            a variety of stocks. Then, utilizing a survey, we discern an individual's risk preference and advise 
            them accordingly, taking into account the volatility of a stock (beta value) against its expected return 
            (using inflation as the risk-free rate and the S&P's average over the past 5 years as the market rate of 
            return). On the front end, we provide the customer with clear and concise advice on which stocks would be
            the best investments for them.
            
            <br><br> <!--every "<br> is a line break (creates a new line)"-->
            
            To put it in simplier terms. Apollo asks you a series of questions that determines how risky you want to invest,
            then using built in python programming, we read the stock-market in real-time and give you our reccomendations for 
            stocks we believe you should invest in at that moment.

            Although we didn't win HackUTD IX, it was certainly a fun time, and more than that, I learned how to hustle, work as a team,
            and be proud of something I created in such a short amount of time. Below, there's a table listing what we did each hour 
            of the 24-hour period. Along with that, to the right of the table is a couple of pictures from the event itself.

                            In between we went to events and workshops that HackUTD was hosting.
