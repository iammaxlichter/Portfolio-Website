<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
This project was started Summer of 2022 and showcases all of the work, experience, and projects that I have done in my CS career.
<br><br>
I've always been passionate about web development, and while searching for a Summer job in my hometown, I decided it was time for me to put my money where my mouth was, and start learning. I developed this project in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will continue to add to it / modify it as my CS career and knowledge on these specific languages continues to grow.
<br><br>
Not only does this website reveal my skills in web development, but it also is a very nice advantage against my fellow applicants when applying for internships and jobs.
<br><br>
Below is what some of the pages on my portfolio website look like.
