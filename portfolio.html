                I was at a standpoint at my love for Computer Science and school had just let out. With me
                being bored and interviewing for a Summer job in my hometown, I decided I need a website to
                keep track of all of my professional achievements / acolades and thus, this website was born.
                
                <br><br>
                
                By absolutely no means is this project nearly where I want to be in terms of Front-End Web Development, but
                by creating this webpage, I dramatically increased my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Re-learning 
                these languages I used from 4+ years ago was incredibly fun. Even though this project is always a work in
                progress, I'm super happy with the outcome. I'll constantly be updating & changing things on this webpage, & 
                on the left is pictures detailing the process
