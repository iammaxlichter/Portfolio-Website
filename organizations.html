                Inside ACM, I engaged in countless discussions relating to coding events such as hackathons in the area, code / tech-related 
                tournaments, and technical workshops analyzing areas of CS. Along wit that, I also taught and helped peers understand their work / programming
                language they were interested in and established mutualistic bonds across the computing community at UTD.
