        <p class = "info"> Hello! My name is Max Lichter, I'm currently a 19 year old Junior majoring in Computer 
            Science at The University of Texas at Dallas.
            <br></br>
            I have been passionate about not only CS, but technology as a whole for most of my life. Given 
            the opportunity to study specifically CS in highschool was a major gateway into the tech field, and
            I am currently aspiring to have a career in this industry post-college. I am currently looking for work 
            opportunities starting Fall 2023.
            <br></br>
            Asides from computer science, I'm also extremely passionate about powerlifting. I have been seriously training
            for a couple of years now. Nothing gets my heart going like powerlifting comeptitions. Some of my side hobbies 
            includes gaming, traveling, and music festivals / concerts.
         </p>
