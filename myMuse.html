                split our-selves into two teams, Front-End & Back-End development. I opted for the Front-End team as
                front-end is something I enjoy very much and was looking to expand my skillset in it.

                We coded MyMuse using Flutter as our framework, Dart as our programming language, Firebase to store the user
                information, Apple Music API for our search and upload song feature, and Android Studio Emulator to see our progress
                as we coded. We had 12 weeks to create our fully functional app, and at the end of said 12 weeks, we presented our project
                to hundreds of students, parents, and peers. Along with that, we were also judged by a group of judges that work inside the tech industry,
                with companies such as Chase, Capital One, and AT&T. The video to the right is known as "Presentation Night", and it's exactly
                how it sounds. all 10 teams gather together to share what they created in the past 12 weeks.

            <li><p class = "describingTextMiddle">at UT Dallas, there exists an organization known as ACM or the "Association
                of Computing Machinery." ACM is built upon five separate divisions. One of those
                divisions is known as ACM Projects. ACM Projects is a semester-long guided projects initiative for those new to software 
                development, teaching collaborative tools, new technologies, and core development principles complimentary to curriculum.
                MyMuse was one of the 10 projects (consisting of 4-5 people) in Fall 2022's rendition of ACM Projects.

                Essentially, MyMuse is a mobile social media platform app that not only allows you to share music with you friends
                at any random point in the day, but can also show you what your friends are listening to at the moment and allow you to comment on 
                your friends posts as well. MyMuse was created by my project manager

                Faiza was my teammates and I's guidance along the way and really helped us develop a total understanding of what
                we were creating.

        <p class = "describingTextBottom">MyMuse was an unforgetable experience and my proudest achievement in my short career inside
            Computer Science. I learned not only the essentials of creating a fully functional website, but also learned how to collaborate
            with a team of people. I learned how to work around 5 peoples different schedules, how to resolve conflicts in coding, AND 
            with my teammates, and I learned the most important skill of all... adapting to my situation. There were so many times 
            something went wrong with MyMuse, but nonetheless, we get the job done and all became better Computer Scientists, Software Engineers,
            and people.
